    <p>Gnocchi are a varied family of dumpling in Italian cuisine.</p>
     <p>They are made of small lumps of dough composed of semolina, ordinary wheat flour, egg, cheese, potato, breadcrumbs, cornmeal or similar ingredients, and possibly including herbs, vegetables, and other ingredients. The dough for gnocchi is most often rolled out before it is cut into small pieces about the size of a wine cork.</p>
    
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 ½ (14.5 ounce) cans passata (crushed tomatoes)</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 (18 ounce) package potato gnocchi</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) ball fresh mozzarella, cubed</li>
        <li>4 fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>


    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>

    <ol>
       <li> Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add passata and salt; simmer over low heat while you prepare the gnocchi.</li>


       <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain.</li>


       <li> Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>


       <li> Pour 1 ladle of tomato sauce into the bottom of a baking dish. Add gnocchi, remaining tomato sauce, and Parmesan cheese; toss to combine. Arrange cubes of mozzarella cheese evenly on top.</li>


       <li> Place baking dish in the oven and broil until mozzarella cheese is melted and sauce has slightly reduced, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and garnish with basil leaves before serving.</li>
    </ol>
